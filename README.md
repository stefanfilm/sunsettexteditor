## Description
My motivation to create this project was to create a text editor that will runs as a PWA. I built this project to create a streamlined way to access a text editor. This application solves the problem of not having a text editor that works well as a PWA. .

## Deployed Site

I was not able to deploy this app because I ran into an issues with a dependency inside of a dependency inside of a package I used called "minimist". The project works at the local host.

## Installation

To install the project, pull the code from https://github.com/stefanfilm/sunsettexteditor and open it in a code editor. Run npm i to install the package json. Run npm start to use the application at local host 3000.

## Usage

Open the code editor and type in code. Organize the text by pressing enter to go to a new line and tab to make space.
